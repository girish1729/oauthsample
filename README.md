# OAuth2 for facebook and Gmail

We will be using Passport to authenticate users with Facebook, and Gmail.

## Instructions

If you would like to download the code and try it for yourself:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/girish1729/oauthsample`
2. Install packages: `npm install`
3. Change out auth credentials in auth.js
4. Launch: `npm start`
5. Visit in your browser at: `http://localhost:3000`

## Other details

I think it is rather easy to setup Oauth2 protocol but the boring part
is setting up your app to access the facebook and Google auth provider.
Once that is done your code can be used to show anyone's credentials.
This can be used in e-commerce websites as well as other login based
websites.

Note that it is vital that you setup your local app to access facebook
or google through the port you configure in the facebook and Google auth
provider UI. You cannot run your app on a different port and expect it
to work.
